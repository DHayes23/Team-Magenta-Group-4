# User Stories

## Owner:
As an owner:

* I want an easy to use, cost-effective solution.
* I want my application to be accessible to my customers at all times.
* I want it to be easy for my developers and engineers to work on the codebase, should changes be required.
* I want all of the data passing through my application and stored in my database to be safe from intrusion.
* I want all of the valuable data collected by the application to be backed-up to ensure that, in the event of a disaster, the data is retained.
## Developer:
As a developer:
* I want to have a development environment which is separate from the production environment, so that I can make experimental changes without affecting the customer experience.
* I want to ensure that the databases are fully functional so they can store, add and delete information.
* I want a new pipeline to automatically initiate every time I make a deployment.
* I want the pipeline to produce logs to assist me in debugging the application.
## Engineer:
As an engineer:
* I want to ensure that the application runs smoothly, regardless of the amount of traffic.
* I want the application to be easy to understand and replicate so it can be reproduced again when needed.
* I want to have a detailed set of logs to monitor and review the application for management and maintenance.
